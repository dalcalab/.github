# Dalcalab Projects and Libraries

## Research Projects
Sometimes these double as a general toolbox, like `voxelmorph`.

 - [VoxelMorph](http://voxelmorph.net/)  
Learning-based image alignment, including VoxelMorph, SynthMorph, AtlasMorph, HyperMorph, etc, and general utilities.  
Both `pytorch` and `tensorflow`, although most is in `tensorflow`.  
Related more experimental library: [voxelmorph-sandbox](https://github.com/adalca/voxelmorph-sandbox) 
 - [UniverSeg](https://github.com/JJGO/UniverSeg)  
Universal Medical Image Segmentation
 - [Hyperlight](https://github.com/JJGO/hyperlight)  
Hypernetworks in Pytorch made easy
 - [Thunderpack](https://github.com/JJGO/thunderpack)  
Blazingly fast multi-modal data format
 - [Topofit](https://github.com/ahoopes/topofit)  
Learning-basedfitting of surfaces to cerebral cortex in brain MRI
