# Dalcalab Projects and Libraries

## Research Projects
Sometimes these double as a general toolbox, like `voxelmorph`.

 - [VoxelMorph](http://voxelmorph.net/)  
Learning-based image alignment, including VoxelMorph, SynthMorph, AtlasMorph, HyperMorph, etc, and general utilities.  
Both `pytorch` and `tensorflow`, although most is in `tensorflow`.  
Related more experimental library: [voxelmorph-sandbox](https://github.com/adalca/voxelmorph-sandbox) 
 - [UniverSeg](https://github.com/JJGO/UniverSeg)  
Universal Medical Image Segmentation
 - [Hyperlight](https://github.com/JJGO/hyperlight)  
Hypernetworks in Pytorch made easy
 - [Thunderpack](https://github.com/JJGO/thunderpack)  
Blazingly fast multi-modal data format
 - [Topofit](https://github.com/ahoopes/topofit)  
Learning-basedfitting of surfaces to cerebral cortex in brain MRI
 - [ScribblePrompt](https://github.com/halleewong/ScribblePrompt)  
Interactive medical image segmentation with bounding boxes, clicks and scribbles 

## Useful libraries
Libraries with tools offering support to the sort of research we do

### Pytorch

 - [voxel](https://github.com/dalcalab/voxel)  
`torch`-focused general purpose medical volume processing
 - [neurite](https://github.com/adalca/neurite)  
medical image analysis, mostly in `tensorflow`/`keras` for now.  
Related more experimental library: [neurite-sandbox](https://github.com/adalca/neurite-sandbox) 
 - [voxynth](https://github.com/dalcalab/voxynth)  
Synthesizing voxel data, based on the generative modeling in SynthSeg, SynthMorph, SynthStrip, etc
 
### Data 
 - [teramedical](https://github.com/teramedical/teramedical)  
large-scale medical data processing library, with dataset-specific processing [in conjunction with [Sabuncu Lab at Cornell](https://sabuncu.engineering.cornell.edu/research/)]
 - [daldata](https://github.com/teramedical/teramedical)
internal library for quickly loading/handling data for torch-based ML projects

### Other public 
 - [surfa](https://github.com/freesurfer/surfa)  
General purpose medical image handling and volume processing (general/non-DL)


## Non-Python libraries

 - [matlib](https://github.com/adalca/matlib)  
extensive `matlab` general purpose libraries

# Internal resources

 - [resources](https://github.com/dalcalab/resources)
